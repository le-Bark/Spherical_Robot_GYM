# Reinforcement Leaning Agent training environment (gym) to control Spherical Robot

## Reinforcement learning-based controller for spherical mobile robots
In a research project, we derived the dynamics model of Norma and Libra, two slider pendulum-driven spherical mobile robots. The complexity of the mathematical equations of motion makes it challenging to control the robot in many maneuvers. 
Modeling Libra in PyBullet enables us to investigate deep reinforcement learning-based controllers to capture the robots' nonlinear and complicated behavior.

## Spherical Robot training environment (gym)
Models of the robot are provided similar to OpenAI API to train RL agents. 


## Dynamics models of spherical mobile robots
The dynamics of the spherical robots are written in Matlab and python and can be used to design controllers of any type.
