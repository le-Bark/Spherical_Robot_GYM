## Reinforcement learning-based controller for spherical mobile robots

In a research project, we derived the dynamics model of Norma and Libra, two slider pendulum-driven spherical mobile robots. The complexity of the mathematical equations of motion makes it challenging to control the robot in many maneuvers. Modeling Libra in PyBullet enables us to investigate deep reinforcement learning-based controllers to capture the robots' nonlinear and complicated behavior.
